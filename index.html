                <!-- Description -->
                <p>
                  TNC360 is a Hyderabad based startup primarily focused on
                  fitness and creating a fitness app that comprises outstanding
                  features to enable the coaches and fitness enthusiasts to
                  create a universe of personal help, advice, training programs,
                  and accountability to achieve the target results.<br /><br />
                  As a UI/UX Design Development Intern at TNC360, I built the
                  TNC360 design system and redesigned the Android/iOS app to
                  help them launch the app in market.

                <span>
                  <h2 class="sub-heading">Redesigning the app</h2>
                  The initial design of the app was very old and it lacked
                  certain modern elements to attract the users hence a redesign
                  was much required.<br /><br />
                  Focusing on the two primary colors on which the whole design
                  was made, I orchestrated and redesigned the app which would be
                  much more suitable to the young fitness enthusiasts while
                  making sure that it doesn't complicate things for other age
                  groups.

                  <h2 class="sub-heading">Building a design system</h2>
                  The redesign of the application required a new design system
                  to be built and maintained which can help other team members
                  develop new features.
                  <br /><br />
                  Therefore I stored all the required components in such a way
                  that most of the elements can be reused while building a new
                  screen or feature for the application without having to build
                  from scratch.

                  JSS Photography Club is the official photography and media

                  photographers, videographers, designers and managers to handle

                  <br /><br />
                  As part of the same club, we designed a website to showcase
                  our work and some information about the team

                  Designing a website requires a certain design system to be
                  built so that it’s easier to create new design elements
                  without having to start from scratch.<br /><br />
                  Therefore a design system was made for the website of JSS
                  Photography Club.

                  technologies. Students from all undergraduate or graduate
                  programs with an interest in growing as a developer are
                  welcome.
                  <br /><br />
                  As a part of GDSC JSSATEN, I designed various applications,
                  websites and worked on numerous projects as a designer as well
                  as a developer with a creative mindset and focused on making
                  people aware of design in our college. I also hosted numerous
                  sessions to talk design so that we as designers can share our

                  There is an annual college fest ‘Zealicon’ which runs for
                  approximately 3-4 days. In that annual fest, numerous events
                  are taking place everyday for students to participate and
                  enjoy and some even at the same time.
                  <br /><br />
                  Keeping track of all these events is a mess and it’s also a
                  stress for students to goto each and every counter to register
                  themselves for the event. It’s also extra work for the
                  organizers of the event to create physical booths for
                  registrations.<br /><br />Build an app so that students can
                  checkout all the events through their smartphone and register
                  themselves in an instant.

            Coming back to the real work that I love to do, I use Figma for most
